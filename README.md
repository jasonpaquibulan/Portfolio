Electricity Spot Market (WESM) Time Forecasting using Facebook Prophet: Created a Philippine’s Electricity Spot Market (WESM) Price Forecast which will then be used for Python Portfolio RAROC Simulation. Preprocessing of data was done in python. Model Training, Cross-validation and Prediction was done entirely using Facebook Prophet. The dataset that was used were the Historical WESM Price which can be downloaded through EIMOP’s website
